## Introduction

This project involves creating a BMI calculator that helps users determine their BMI based on their weight and height. The project has two versions:
1. **Command-Line BMI Calculator** for beginners.
2. **Graphical BMI Calculator** for advanced users.

## Features

### Command-Line BMI Calculator

- **User Input:** Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- **BMI Calculation:** Accurately implement the BMI formula.
- **Categorization:** Classify the BMI result into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges.
- **Display:** Show the BMI result and category to the user.

### Graphical BMI Calculator

- **User Input Validation:** Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
- **BMI Calculation:** Accurately implement the BMI formula.
- **Categorization:** Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
- **GUI Design:** Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays using Tkinter.
- **Data Storage:** Implement user data storage using file storage.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts.
- **Error Handling:** Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval.
- **User Experience:** Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear instructions and feedback.
